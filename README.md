Ursina is a game engine that utilizes only Python code.

There are videos on youtube by its creator demonstrating use cases and tutorials. I didnt get very far into development before getting a bit overwhelmed from the lack of a community and support. 

Feel free to take what I've managed to create and run with it!

WARNING: I created this long before truly grasping how to optimize code. I hadnt learned a thing about object oriented coding yet, so this project was way outside of my scope.
