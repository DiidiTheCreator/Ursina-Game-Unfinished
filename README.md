Ursina is a game engine that completely utilizes Python.

There are videos on youtube by its creator demonstrating use cases and tutorials. I didnt get very far into development before getting a bit overwhelmed from the lack of a community and support. 

Feel free to take what I've managed to create and run with it!

WARNING: I created this long before truly grasping how to optimize code.
